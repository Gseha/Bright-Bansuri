                    <TD>This is the embou­chure, or the blowing hole.  pro­fes­sional quality bansuris in India are invariably of the trans­verse variety.  How­ever, there are also a num­ber of fipple flutes which are also available.  These are some­times found among folk music­ians and they are fre­quen­tly given to chil­dren as toys.</TD>

                    <TD>These are the finger holes.  They are the holes that are used to play the melodies.  For a 7-hole flute as shown in the side pic­ture, the mus­ical intervals are: half-step, whole-step, whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step, whole-step. </TD>

                    <TD> The body of the bansuri tends to crack.  This is sim­ply one of the undesir­able qualities of bamboo and reed.  This cracking may be re­duced or elimi­nated by tightly binding the body with twine.  This is known as rassi.  One trick used by craftsmen to assure an even and reproducible tension is to tie a fixed weight to the end of the string and slowly turn the body of the bansuri to wrap the twine around it.</TD>
