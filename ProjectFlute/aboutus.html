    <p class="small">Greetings to Everyone, Sehaj here.<br>
Very warm welcome to my website. I have created the website with the objective to teach how to play Bansuri.<br>
The website covers all the aspects regarding Hindustani classical music and Bansuri that a beginner needs to know.</p>
<br><br>
    <p class="small"> What inspired me to make this website is the fact that I don't want anyone to face the harships that I face while learning flute.<br>
There was no good site available that could teach me the basics of playing a flute and even if there was, the cost to access it was way too far than what I could afford.<br>
Encore Flutes will basically provide the concepts regarding Music and Bansuri, so that Beginners who are really upto learning flute can have resources available to them.</p>
<br>
     <p class="small">I have been learning flute from the past one year, since I didnot have a Guru-based approach, I went too fast in the flute learning and the website also highlight my personal mistakes, so no other could repeat them.</p>
<br>
    <p class="small">I am currently 15 years old and I have just completed my 10th grade. I am an enthusiastic learnr and this website Encore Flutes is the accumulation of the things and Concepts that I have learnt till now.</p>
<br>
     <P class="small"> Hope you appreciate my sincere efforts. I really want to know your precious views and hence do give your feeback to us through <a>Talk to Us</a> tab.</P>
